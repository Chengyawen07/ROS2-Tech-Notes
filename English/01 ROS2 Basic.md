## 1. **What is ROS 2?**
ROS 2 is an open-source framework designed for robotics development, enabling distributed systems, real-time capabilities, and multi-language support. It provides a modular toolchain to help developers build and deploy robotic applications efficiently.

**Basic Architecture and Functions**

1. **Nodes**
   - Purpose: The smallest computational unit in ROS 2, each node is typically responsible for a specific task (e.g., controlling sensors, data processing).
   - Role: Enables modular design, making systems easier to maintain and scale. Nodes can run in parallel, supporting distributed computing.
2. **Topics**
   - Purpose: Communication channels for stateless data transfer between nodes using a publish-subscribe model.
   - Role: Used for transmitting data such as sensor readings or control commands. For example, a camera node publishes image data to a topic, and other nodes can subscribe to process the images.
3. **Services**
   - Purpose: Request-response communication mechanism between nodes, suitable for short-term tasks.
   - Role: Used for synchronous operations, e.g., requesting coordinates for a target during robot movement.
4. **Actions**
   - Purpose: Enables request-feedback mechanisms for long-running tasks.
   - Role: For example, navigation tasks allow nodes to report progress or cancel operations midway.
5. **DDS (Data Distribution Service)**
   - Purpose: The underlying communication middleware providing reliable publish-subscribe functionality.
   - Role: Supports real-time performance, distributed computing, and cross-platform communication.
6. **Parameters**
   - Purpose: Stores and manages configuration parameters needed by nodes at runtime.
   - Role: Enables dynamic parameter adjustment without restarting nodes, such as modifying robot speed.
7. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Purpose: Manages node states (e.g., inactive, active, shutting down).
   - Role: Enhances system controllability and stability, particularly for complex applications.
8. **Toolchain**
   - Purpose: Includes rviz (visualization tool), rosbag (data recording tool), colcon (build tool), etc.
   - Role: Simplifies development, debugging, and runtime processes.





### **Summary of ROS 2 Core Components**

## 2. **What is a Node?**
 A node is the basic execution unit in ROS 2, responsible for handling specific tasks, such as acquiring sensor data, data processing, or robot control. Multiple nodes work together through ROS 2 communication mechanisms (e.g., Topics, Services, Actions) to enable distributed computing.

**How to Create a Simple Node in ROS 2?**

Below are examples of how to create a simple node in **ROS 2 Humble**, using **Python** and **C++**.

------

### **Python Example**

1. **Install Dependencies**
    Ensure `rclpy` is installed, and your ROS 2 environment is properly configured.

2. **Node Code**

   ```python
   import rclpy
   from rclpy.node import Node
   
   class SimpleNode(Node):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__('simple_node')
           self.get_logger().info('Simple Node is running in ROS 2 Humble.')
   
   def main(args=None):
       rclpy.init(args=args)
       node = SimpleNode()
       rclpy.spin(node)
       node.destroy_node()
       rclpy.shutdown()
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()
   ```

3. **Run the Node**

   - Create a Python package (if you don’t already have one):

     ```bash
     ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python my_python_pkg
     ```

   - Save the code as `simple_node.py` in the `my_python_pkg/my_python_pkg` directory.

   - Update the 

     ```
     setup.py
     ```

      file to register the node in 

     ```
     entry_points
     ```

     :

     ```python
     entry_points={
         'console_scripts': [
             'simple_node = my_python_pkg.simple_node:main',
         ],
     },
     ```

   - Build the package:

     ```bash
     colcon build --packages-select my_python_pkg
     ```

   - Run the node:

     ```bash
     ros2 run my_python_pkg simple_node
     ```

------

### **C++ Example**

1. **Install Dependencies**
    Ensure `rclcpp` and `std_msgs` are installed, and your ROS 2 environment is properly configured.

2. **Node Code**

   ```cpp
   #include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
   
   class SimpleNode : public rclcpp::Node {
   public:
       SimpleNode() : Node("simple_node") {
           RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Simple Node is running in ROS 2 Humble.");
       }
   };
   
   int main(int argc, char **argv) {
       rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
       auto node = std::make_shared<SimpleNode>();
       rclcpp::spin(node);
       rclcpp::shutdown();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Run the Node**

   - Create a C++ package (if you don’t already have one):

     ```bash
     ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake my_cpp_pkg
     ```

   - Save the code as `simple_node.cpp` in the `my_cpp_pkg/src` directory.

   - Update the 

     ```
     CMakeLists.txt
     ```

      file to include:

     ```cmake
     add_executable(simple_node src/simple_node.cpp)
     ament_target_dependencies(simple_node rclcpp)
     install(TARGETS simple_node DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME})
     ```

   - Build the package:

     ```bash
     colcon build --packages-select my_cpp_pkg
     ```

   - Run the node:

     ```bash
     ros2 run my_cpp_pkg simple_node
     ```

------

### **Notes**

- **Python Packages**: Ensure the node is registered in `setup.py` under `entry_points` and that dependencies like `rclpy` are added to `package.xml`.
- **C++ Packages**: Make sure dependencies like `rclcpp` are properly declared in both `CMakeLists.txt` and `package.xml`.





## 3. **What is a Topic?**

A **topic** is a communication mechanism in ROS 2 that allows nodes to exchange data using a **publish-subscribe model**.

- **Publisher:** Sends data to a specific topic.
- **Subscriber:** Listens to a specific topic and receives the data.

Think of a **topic as a radio station**:

1. **Radio station (Publisher):** Broadcasts music (data).
2. **Radio receivers (Subscribers):** Tune into the station to receive and play the music.

In ROS 2, multiple nodes work together through topics. For example:

- **Camera node:** Publishes image data to the `/camera_image` topic.
- **Processing node:** Subscribes to the `/camera_image` topic to process the image.

------

### **How to Publish and Subscribe to Topics in ROS 2?**

Below is a complete example of publishing and subscribing to a topic in Python.

------

#### **Publisher Code**

**Functionality:** Publishes a message to the topic `/chatter` every 0.5 seconds.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String  # Message type

class SimplePublisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('simple_publisher')  # Node name
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'chatter', 10)  # Create publisher
        self.timer = self.create_timer(0.5, self.timer_callback)  # Timer callback every 0.5 seconds
        self.get_logger().info('Publisher is running!')  # Log message

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()  # Create a message object
        msg.data = 'Hello, ROS 2!'  # Set the message data
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)  # Publish the message
        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')  # Log the published data

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = SimplePublisher()
    rclpy.spin(node)  # Keep the node running
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Steps to Run:**

1. Save the code as `publisher.py`.

2. Run the publisher:

   ```bash
   ros2 run <package_name> publisher
   ```

------

#### **Subscriber Code**

**Functionality:** Subscribes to the `/chatter` topic and prints the received messages.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String  # Message type

class SimpleSubscriber(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('simple_subscriber')  # Node name
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            String, 'chatter', self.listener_callback, 10)  # Create subscriber
        self.subscription  # Prevent garbage collection
        self.get_logger().info('Subscriber is running!')  # Log message

    def listener_callback(self, msg):
        self.get_logger().info(f'Received: "{msg.data}"')  # Log the received message

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = SimpleSubscriber()
    rclpy.spin(node)  # Keep the node running
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Steps to Run:**

1. Save the code as `subscriber.py`.

2. Run the subscriber:

   ```bash
   ros2 run <package_name> subscriber
   ```

------

#### **Run Both Publisher and Subscriber**

- Start the 

  publisher

  :

  ```bash
  ros2 run <package_name> publisher
  ```

- Start the 

  subscriber

  :

  ```bash
  ros2 run <package_name> subscriber
  ```

You should see output like this in the subscriber terminal:

```
[INFO] [<timestamp>] [simple_subscriber]: Received: "Hello, ROS 2!"
```

------

### **Code Explanation**

1. **Message Type (`std_msgs.msg.String`)**:
    ROS 2 uses standard message types (e.g., `String`) to define the structure of the data being sent and received.
2. **Publisher Workflow:**
   - `create_publisher`: Creates a publisher for the topic.
   - `create_timer`: Triggers the `timer_callback` function periodically.
   - `publish`: Sends the message to the topic.
3. **Subscriber Workflow:**
   - `create_subscription`: Creates a subscriber for the topic.
   - `listener_callback`: Automatically called whenever a message is received.

------

### **Summary**

- **Topics** are a key communication mechanism in ROS 2, ideal for streaming real-time data (e.g., sensor readings, robot states).
- A **publisher** sends messages, and a **subscriber** receives them.
- Using ROS 2’s standard interfaces, developers can quickly build modular and scalable robotic systems.

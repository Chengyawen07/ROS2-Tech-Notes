### **What is a Launch File?**

A **Launch File** in ROS 2 is a tool used to start, configure, and manage one or multiple nodes. It simplifies the process of launching complex systems by defining nodes, parameters, environment variables, and more.

**Key Features:**

1. **Launch Multiple Nodes:** Start multiple nodes with a single command.
2. **Configure Parameters:** Pass parameters to nodes at launch time (e.g., topic names, frame IDs).
3. **Set Environment Variables:** Adjust environment variables for specific runtime needs.
4. **Flexibility:** Supports conditional logic, event triggers, and dynamic parameter passing.

------

### **Features of Launch Files in ROS 2**

- ROS 2 launch files are written in **Python** (unlike XML in ROS 1).
- They are modular and dynamic, allowing runtime customization and conditional configurations.
- Use the **`launch_ros`** and **`launch`** libraries for defining nodes and configurations.

### **How to Use a Launch File to Start Multiple Nodes in ROS 2?**

Below is a step-by-step guide to create and use a launch file for starting multiple nodes.

------

#### **Step 1: Create a Launch File**

1. Create a 

   ```
   launch
   ```

    directory in your package:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p <package_name>/launch
   ```

2. Create a new launch file, e.g., 

   ```
   my_launch.py
   ```

   :

   ```bash
   touch <package_name>/launch/my_launch.py
   ```

------

#### **Step 2: Write the Launch File**

Here’s an example launch file to start two nodes: a `talker` node and a `listener` node.

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='demo_nodes_cpp',  # The package containing the node
            executable='talker',       # The executable to run
            name='talker_node',        # The name of the node
            output='screen'            # Log output to the screen
        ),
        Node(
            package='demo_nodes_py',   # The package containing the node
            executable='listener',    # The executable to run
            name='listener_node',     # The name of the node
            output='screen'           # Log output to the screen
        ),
    ])
```

**Explanation:**

1. `Node`:

    Defines the nodes to be launched, specifying:

   - **`package`:** The ROS 2 package containing the node.
   - **`executable`:** The node's executable name.
   - **`name`:** (Optional) A custom name for the node.
   - **`output`:** Specifies where to send logs (`screen` for terminal, or `log` for files).

2. **`LaunchDescription`:** A container that holds all the nodes to be launched.

------

#### **Step 3: Run the Launch File**

Run the launch file using the `ros2 launch` command:

```bash
ros2 launch <package_name> my_launch.py
```

------

### **Adding Parameters and Configuration**

#### **1. Node Parameters**

You can pass parameters to a node at launch:

```python
Node(
    package='demo_nodes_cpp',
    executable='talker',
    name='talker_node',
    output='screen',
    parameters=[
        {'publish_rate': 10.0}  # Set a parameter for the node
    ]
)
```

#### **2. Using Launch Arguments**

You can declare launch-time arguments to dynamically set parameters:

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node
from launch.actions import DeclareLaunchArgument
from launch.substitutions import LaunchConfiguration

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        DeclareLaunchArgument('rate', default_value='5.0', description='Publish rate'),
        Node(
            package='demo_nodes_cpp',
            executable='talker',
            name='talker_node',
            output='screen',
            parameters=[
                {'publish_rate': LaunchConfiguration('rate')}  # Use the launch argument
            ]
        ),
    ])
```

Run the launch file with a custom argument:

```bash
ros2 launch <package_name> my_launch.py rate:=10.0
```

------

### **Conditional Launch and Events**

#### **1. Conditional Launch**

You can conditionally launch nodes based on runtime arguments:

```python
from launch.conditions import IfCondition
from launch.substitutions import LaunchConfiguration

Node(
    package='demo_nodes_cpp',
    executable='talker',
    name='conditional_talker',
    output='screen',
    condition=IfCondition(LaunchConfiguration('enable_talker'))  # Launch only if enable_talker is true
)
```

Run with the condition:

```bash
ros2 launch <package_name> my_launch.py enable_talker:=true
```

------

### **Complete Example: Launching a Complex System**

Here’s a full example demonstrating multiple nodes with parameters and conditions:

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node
from launch.actions import DeclareLaunchArgument
from launch.substitutions import LaunchConfiguration

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        DeclareLaunchArgument('enable_talker', default_value='true', description='Enable the talker node'),
        DeclareLaunchArgument('talker_rate', default_value='5.0', description='Talker publish rate'),

        Node(
            package='demo_nodes_cpp',
            executable='talker',
            name='talker_node',
            output='screen',
            parameters=[{'publish_rate': LaunchConfiguration('talker_rate')}],
            condition=IfCondition(LaunchConfiguration('enable_talker'))  # Conditional launch
        ),
        Node(
            package='demo_nodes_py',
            executable='listener',
            name='listener_node',
            output='screen'
        ),
    ])
```

Run the launch file with custom arguments:

```bash
ros2 launch <package_name> my_launch.py enable_talker:=false talker_rate:=10.0
```

------
